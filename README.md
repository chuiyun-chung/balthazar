# Balthazar

A modern AI project inspired by legacy systems. This repo simulates extracting COBOL-style mainframe data and applies basic AI/ML workflows to it.

## Structure

- `data/`: Sample legacy fixed-width text data
- `src/`: Python code for data parsing and processing
- `notebooks/`: Space for Jupyter notebooks and analysis
